# LearningJS
I am currently learning JavaScript. Hopefully my code can help someone else trying to learn one day.
Inside the code folder I will have other folders in sections in order of what to learn first. Example: Sec1_Variables_PrimitiveTypes is the first section
Sec1 stands for section 1 and will continue on with that pattern
Note: Some code will have errors but will have comments above them explaining why they are errors
